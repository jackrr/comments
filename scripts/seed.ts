    title: "Why Shoes Belong on Your Hands",
    content: `Let's challenge convention: shoes aren't just for feet anymore. Wearing shoes on your hands offers surprising advantages that podiatrists don't want you to know about.
First, superior grip. Those treaded soles that help you navigate icy sidewalks? They're equally effective for climbing trees, opening stubborn jars, or dominating at rock-paper-scissors. Your opponents won't see it coming.
Second, protection. Why do we baby our hands with flimsy gloves when industrial-strength footwear exists? Shoe-hands laugh at thorny roses, hot stovetops, and awkward handshakes with people who squeeze too hard.
Third, fashion revolution. Tired of boring mittens? Strap on some light-up sneakers and become the life of every party. Jazz hands have nothing on jazz feet-hands.
Finally, efficiency. You're already buying shoes. Why invest in separate hand protection when your Crocs are right there, waiting to fulfill their true multipurpose destiny?
Free your hands. Shoe them.`,
